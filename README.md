A program that imitates a coffee machine. The program initially prompts use user for the type of coffee. After the program checks whether there are enough resources. If yes, the computer asks to insert money for the desired coffee. The money can be inserted in the form of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. If the total sum of the inserted money is greater than the cost of the desired coffee then the machine makes the coffee and deducts the resources spent on the coffee from the total resources prior to making the coffee. The user can see the resources by inserting the phrase 'report' when asked what type of coffee is wanted.
